# Toilet Timer
A little client-only app that helps you track your toilet time. Written in Typescript. It utilizes local storage on the browser to store timer data and load it on page visits. 

## Usage
Create a new timer, and give it a name. Stop the timer when you're finished. Save the timer if you want it to persist through page refreshes.
